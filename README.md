# The PatternMaker

# Program Requirements: 
You will need some text files with the initial patterns to start the P9 Game of Life program.  You will build a program to create a text file containing the initial pattern.  It will be called Lastname Patternmaker and will create text files with one pattern at a time for the grid of 45 rows and 78 columns.  

It will begin by filling the 2_D grid with '.', which means that the cell is dead.   

Then code an initial pattern of live cells by placing '*' in those cells.  

Open an output stream and either hard-code or ask the user for a filename.  Name the file something descriptive, like "bar.txt" or "cross.txt." 

The first line of the file will be the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, with a space in between:   45 78.  

Then write out the grid into the file. 

This file will provide the initial pattern for your Game of Life.

You will create at least 5 of these text files containing different initial patterns and paste them into the source code of your P9 Game of Life program.
